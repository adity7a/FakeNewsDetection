# FakeNewsDetection
This project aims to detect fake news articles using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We trained multiple models on an Indian news dataset covering politics, cricket, Bollywood, elections, and COVID-19. The system classifies news as FAKE or TRUE based on the statement text.
